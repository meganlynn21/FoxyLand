I put in a health score with 5 lives and a cherry counter to the upper left hand corner of the screen. If you get hit by the frogs 5 times or you fall off a ledge, you die and the level will start over. If you jump on their heads you kill them. You can collect cherries. The goal is to get home to the end. I plan on adding a lot more, this is just a starter. I used a bunch of animations and used C# programming.

Enjoy the game! 
USE A TO MOVE LEFT AND D TO MOVE RIGHT OR YOU CAN USE THE ARROW KEYS AND SPACE BAR TO JUMP
